# SDU-Booking-Helper

This script is based off of Javascript, and makes it easy and simple to book rooms for TEK-students.

To use the script, you either have to install the extension TamperMonkey (Chrome) or Greasemonkey (Firefox), both of which allows you to execute scripts in your browser.
After installing the extension, do the following:

1. Open the JavaScript file in the repository. 
2. Press the button to convert the code to a raw format (RAW)
! [Image of the script]
   ![RawImage](https://github.com/[simonkruger10]/[reponame]/blob/[branch]/image.jpg?raw=true)

3. Copy the code in question, all of it.
4. Click on the extension symbol, go to dashboard. 
5. Press the "+" icon (create new script).
6. Paste the code into TamperMonkey / Greasemonkey.
